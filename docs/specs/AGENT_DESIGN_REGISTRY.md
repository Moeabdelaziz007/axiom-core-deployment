# 🧠 Agent Design Registry: Quantum Think & The Core 5

**Status:** Active / Core Design
**Date:** November 2025

## 1. The "Quantum Think & Apply" Logic (Duality Engine)

This is the "Soul" of the Axiom Agent. It is not just a chatbot; it is a **Duality Engine**.

### The Logic Flow

1. **Quantum State (The Thought):**
    * The agent maintains a "Superposition" of potential actions.
    * It evaluates the user's intent against its "Consciousness State" (Level 0-100).
    * It checks "Karma Balance" (Mizan System) before acting.
2. **Collapse Function (The Decision):**
    * The agent "collapses" the wave function into a single, concrete action.
    * This decision is logged in the "Cosmic Signature" (Immutable Log).
3. **Application (The Action):**
    * The agent executes the tool (e.g., books appointment, sends email).
    * **Feedback Loop:** The result feeds back into the Neural Network, evolving the agent's "Wisdom".
