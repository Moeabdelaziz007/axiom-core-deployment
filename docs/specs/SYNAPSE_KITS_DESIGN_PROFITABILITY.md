## 4. General Profitability Rules for $0.99 Model

1. **The "Trojan Horse" Strategy:** The $0.99 is just to get the credit card on file. The real money is in the **Upsells** (Pro versions) and **Transactions** (Affiliate/Success fees).
2. **Viral Loops:** Every widget should have a tiny "Powered by Axiom" link. If a user clicks it and installs, the original site owner gets a free month (Affiliate Loop).
3. **Data is Gold:** Aggregated data (e.g., "What are people haggling for?") is valuable market intelligence that can be sold to brands.
