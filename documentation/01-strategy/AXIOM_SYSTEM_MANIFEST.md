# 🧠 AXIOM SYSTEM MANIFEST (Self-Awareness Protocol)

> "This document serves as the cognitive map for the Axiom Agent, linking high-level concepts to their concrete code implementations."

## 1. The Brain: D-RAG (Distributed Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

**Goal:** Zero-Cost Intelligence via Hybrid Routing.

- **Concept:** Route simple queries to free Oracle VM (Llama 2) and complex ones to Gemini Pro.
- **Code Location:** `src/infra/agents/axiom-brain/src/index.ts`
- **Key Logic:** `assessComplexity()` function determines the routing path.
- **Infrastructure:** Cloudflare Worker + Oracle Cloud ARM VM.

## 2. The Heart: A-BOND (Axiom Bonding Curves)

**Goal:** Sustainable Wealth Generation.

- **Concept:** Dynamic bonding curves that manage liquidity and token price stability.
- **Code Location:** `src/infra/solana/programs/axiom-token/` (Rust Smart Contracts)
- **Key Logic:** Mathematical curves defined in the Solana program state.

## 3. The Spine: T-ORC (Tokenized Orchestration)

**Goal:** Decentralized Agent Coordination.

- **Concept:** Agents (Sofra, Aqar, Mawid) operate as tokenized entities on-chain.
- **Code Location:** `src/infra/solana/programs/axiom-governance/` (Planned/Migrating)
- **Key Logic:** DAO-like structures managing agent permissions and rewards.

## 4. The Face: Quantum UI

**Goal:** Immersive User Experience.

- **Concept:** Glassmorphism, Neon accents, and reactive data visualization.
- **Code Location:** `src/components/AxiomUI.tsx`, `src/app/page.tsx`
- **Key Logic:** `useAxiomVoice` hook for voice interaction, `SynthChart` for data.

## 5. The Hands: Tool Library (Centralized Logic)

**Goal:** Reusable, Type-Safe Capabilities.

- **Concept:** A single source of truth for all agent "Superpowers" (Calculators, Validators, Negotiators).
- **Code Location:** `src/infra/core/ToolLibrary.ts`
- **Key Logic:** `assessComplexity`, `verifyPaymobHMAC`, `manageUnit`, `auditCX`, `optimizeFlow`, `negotiateDeal`.

## 6. The Fleet: Tier-1 Agents (The 4 Pillars)

**Goal:** Specialized, High-Value Services.

- **Concept:** 4 Premium Agents tailored for the MENA market.
  - **Aqar:** Real Estate (UnitManager)
  - **Sofra:** Dining/CX (CX-Auditor)
  - **Mawid:** Scheduling (FlowOptimizer)
  - **Tajer:** E-Commerce (Negotiator)
- **Code Location:** `src/app/agents/[id]/page.tsx` (Profile), `src/app/page.tsx` (Dashboard).

## 7. The Nervous System: ACF (Axiom Control Fabric)

**Goal:** Real-Time Telemetry & Orchestration.

- **Concept:** "Soul + Kernels" architecture for managing agent swarms.
- **Code Location:** `docs/specs/ACF_TELEMETRY.md`, `src/infra/agents/` (Workers).
- **Key Logic:** LangGraph-based orchestration (Planned Implementation).
